# Easy68k-Disassembler-
This program is intended to read and take in machine code and output the disassembled code to a console., as well as log it to a text file via the userâ€™s selection. To further explain, the machine code being taken in is taken in as binary data in memory and the program is to convert the data into a set of instructions, addressing modes, and operands all within a set of addresses. The disassembler is written entirely in 68000 Assembly Code and provides a minute user interface to print out the disassembled code in a desired manner.

Our program was designed in such a way to take in a long hex address to set a starting and ending address for the desired file to be read. The I/O Console then prompts the user with a set of numbers and depending on the user input, the console will either 1) display the disassembled code 15 lines at a time, 2) print the disassembled code all at once without pause, and 3) exit and end the program.
